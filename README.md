# confined-water-analysis

Package to analyse molecular dynamics trajectories of water confined in low-dimensional materials, e.g. graphene or hexagonal boron nitride. 

Tests can be run using `pytest` from the `tests` directory.

To make sure the code runs properly and does not return false results, it is recommended to wrap the trajectories you would like to use. This can be done with VMD and an example can be found in `helpers/vmd/wrapping_trajectories`.
